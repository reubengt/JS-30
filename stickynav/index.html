     <p>Epic cheeseburgers come in all kinds of manifestations, but we want them in and around our mouth no matter what. Slide those smashed patties with the gently caramelized meat fat between a toasted brioche bun and pass it over. You fall in love with the cheeseburger itself but the journey ain’t half bad either.</p>
     <p>Any day without a cheeseburger in it is a waste. You can find a cheeseburger no matter where you go in the world, so you have no excuse to miss out on the glory that some people can only dream of. Step up to the plate.</p>

     <p>The palatable sensation we lovingly refer to as The Cheeseburger has a distinguished and illustrious history. It was born from humble roots, only to rise to well-seasoned greatness.</p>
     <p>They’re the childhood friend that knows your highest highs and lowest lows. They’ve been with you through thick and thin and they’re the best at keeping secrets. Whether it’s dressed up or informal, cheeseburgers have your back.</p>

     <p>Sometimes we lose sight of what really matters in life. There’s something to be said for a gourmet brie and truffle burger paired with parmesan frites, but don’t let that make you forget about the ol’ faithful with American cheddar and a squishy bun. Lettuce remind you that cheeseburgers come in all forms - bun intended.</p>
     <p>There is debate on who painstakingly birthed our favourite monumental flavor creation into existence. What really matters is that, at the end of the day, we can collectively relish in the sweet glory of it all. From beef-to-bun ratio, ‘how much is too much?’ cheese, and the careful alchemy of condiments, every cheeseburger is a small mountain of heaven.</p>
     <p>We are lucky to live in a glorious age that gives us everything we could ask for as a human race. What more could you need when you have meat covered in cheese nestled between bread as a complete meal.</p>
     <p>Think of cheeseburgers like a Tinder match. They might not all be your soulmate but you’ve gotta find out to be sure. It can get a little messy and that’s just part of the fun.</p>
     <p>Some are cheesy, others can be a little dry, and the rare few are a disaster. There are so many cheeseburgers out there it can be hard to commit to just one favourite. That being said, when you know, you just know.</p>
     <p>Everyone has their perfect match. Sometimes it’s just around the corner, other times you have to travel the world in search of it. Wherever your perfect cheeseburger is, it’s out there.</p>

     <p>Pop quiz: what’s the greatest thing to happen to your mind, body, and soul in recent history? A cheeseburger, obviously. Cheeseburgers know that what you want can also be what you need.</p>
     <p>The last time you had a cheeseburger was too long ago. Try not to drool when you think about the slightly charred, medium-rare meat nestled between soft brioche, cradled in crisp iceberg lettuce and flavour amplifying condiments. Why are you still reading this- go get a cheeseburger.</p>
