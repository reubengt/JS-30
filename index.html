  <h1>JS30 Projects by Reuben George Thomas</h1>
  <p> Hey, This is a list of projects I made to practice my vanilla JavaScript skills, by following <a href="https://javascript30.com" target=_blank>WesBos' JS30 course.</a> Please note that these are just to practice javascript, and several of these projects use mouse and physical keyboard input. Responsive Design has not been a huge priority while making them, and although the sites will probably look fine on mobile devices, not all functionality has been translated. Open on a PC for best results.</p>
